## Objective
Engage at least 20 potential attendees for the birthday party through creative marketing strategies.

## Strategies

### 1. **Leverage Upselling Techniques**
   - Offer customizable party packages that include fun extras such as goodie bags, personalized cups, and themed decor.
   - Consider providing add-ons like a "party lanyard" or special games at checkout to increase participant engagement.

### 2. **Create a Birthday Club**
   - Set up a “Birthday Club” where parents can sign up their children. Offer incentives such as a discount or a special gift for members.
   - Use this database to reach out to parents two months before their children's birthdays with promotional materials about your party offers.

### 3. **Utilize Social Media Marketing**
   - Create vibrant and engaging posts about the birthday party on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
   - Use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience and consider boosting posts with a small budget to target local families.

### 4. **Host a Contest or Giveaway**
   - Run a “win a free birthday party” contest on social media or through local family magazines. This will generate excitement and encourage sharing.
   - Use Survey Monkey to gather information about the children's party preferences while entering the contest.

### 5. **Develop Informative Content**
   - Write informative blog posts or articles on the top 10 tips for a successful children's birthday party, and share them on social media and local publications.
   - This could also include tips on creating unique themes or fun activities for kids.

### 6. **Distribute Leaflets or Promotional Materials**
   - Create eye-catching leaflets that detail the birthday party offerings. Distribute them at local family-oriented businesses, coffee shops, and schools.
   - Make use of local community boards to post information about the birthday party.

### 7. **Offer Online Booking & Scheduling**
   - Make it easy for parents to book the birthday party online. A user-friendly booking system available 24/7 will attract more attendees.
   - Ensure your website clearly outlines the booking process and party details.

### 8. **Engage with Local Groups and Networks**
   - Collaborate with local parent groups or community centers to promote your party services through their networks.
   - Attend local family-oriented events and fairs to promote the birthday party and meet potential attendees face to face.

### 9. **Run a Free Introductory Session**
   - Host a free event or class as a sneak peek of what the birthday party experience will offer. Encourage sign-ups by capturing attendee details for future marketing.
   - This can create buzz and give parents a direct experience of the fun their children will have.
